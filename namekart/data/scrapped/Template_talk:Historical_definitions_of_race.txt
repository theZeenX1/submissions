Remove "Diachronic"
The "diachronic" part has nothing to do with "Historical definitions of race". Although some racists like to connect their fringe theories about race with archeogenetics, the consensus in modern biological / genetic / anthropologic science is that "race" cannot meaningfully be applied to humans in those sciences. I suggest to remove the whole line "Diachronic". --Rsk6400 (talk) 09:09, 20 July 2020 (UTC)[reply]
