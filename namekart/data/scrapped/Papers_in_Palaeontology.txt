The Palaeontological Association (PalAss for short) is a charitable organisation[1] based in the UK founded in 1957 for the promotion of the study of palaeontology and its allied sciences.

Publications
The Association publishes two main journals: Palaeontology and Papers in Palaeontology. The latter is the successor to the now discontinued Special Papers in Palaeontology. In addition, the Palaeontology Newsletter is published 3 times per year, and the Field Guides to Fossils series covering important palaeontological biotas is published in book form.

Awards
The Association confers a number of awards, including the Gertrude Elles Award for high-quality public engagement; the Mary Anning Award for outstanding contributions from those not professionally employed in palaeontology; the Hodson Award for exceptional early-career achievement; the President's Medal as a mid-career award; and the organisation's highest award for exceptional lifetime achievement, the Lapworth Medal.[2]
