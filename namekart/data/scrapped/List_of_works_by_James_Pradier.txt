Busts and statues of Louis Philippe I and other members of Royal family
Pardier was well regarded by the king and was commissioned to execute several busts and statues of family members as well as effigies for family tombs. Below is a photograph of Pradier's 1834 bust of Louis Philippe I (1773-1850) who reigned from 1830 to 1848 in the period known as the July monarchy. This bust can be seen in the Musée du Louvre département des Sculptures. Several busts of the King were executed by Pradier. The first was in 1830, a plaster bust celebrating Louis-Philippe's accession to the French throne and in a bust executed in 1841, the king is depicted wearing a crown of oak leaves. Pradier also executed works depicting Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, the King's wife. One such work can be seen in the Chateau de Chantilly. When Ferdinand-Philippe Duke of Orléans, the King's eldest son was killed in an accident in 1842, Louis-Philippe commissioned Pradier to take casts of Ferdinand-Philippe's head, hands and feet to ensure that any future sculptures would be true to his son's likeness and Pradier produced several works using these casts including a memorial bust, a monument to the Duke and a bronze medallion[30][31][32][33][34][35]

Public statues and monuments outside of Paris
Pradier's grandfather had been from the Gard region and apart from his work in Paris his friends in the French MIDI, particularly Nîmes, helped him secure commissions in that area. Some of these are listed below.

A statue executed in plaster.[36][37]

Nîmes was enjoying a period of prosperity when, in 1844, it was decided to construct this public fountain to celebrate Nîmes' various sources of water. The architect Charles-Auguste Questel was charged with the fountain's design and Pradier with the sculptural work involved and a plaster model of the proposed fountain can be seen in the Nîmes Musée de beaux-arts.  At the centre of Questel/Pradier's composition is a female representation of Nîmes, who holds an olive branch in one hand symbolizing the wish to appease Nîmes' religious and political divisions and in her other hand she holds a shield bearing the arms of Nîmes. On her head Pradier puts a somewhat bizarre crown which includes the façades of Nîmes' ancient buildings, the Arena of Nîmes and the colonnaded Maison Carrée and the Palais de Justice, newly constructed in a neo-classical style. Four allegories placed beneath the statue representing Nîmes, celebrate the four sources of water and each has its name written in Latin. A seated Jupiter represents the river Rhône, Latin "Rhodanus", one of whose arms rests of a mask of "tragedy" and from which water flows into the central basin.  The river Gardon, "Vardo" in Latin, a tributary of the Rhône, is symbolized by Neptune and his trident and his feet rest on an amphora from which water flows.  Two springs, the sources of water other than the Rhône and the Gardon are represented by two nymphs. One represents the source known as "L’Eure" or "Ura" in Latin, which originates from a spring near Uzès and the other the "Fontaine de Nîmes" or "Namausa" in Latin, this spring used by the Romans in the early colony[38][39][40]

Pradier's monument to Louis IX was inaugurated in 1849 and originally comprised a bronze depiction of the king on a pedestal but in 1896 it was converted into a public fountain and dolphins and basins were added to the pedestal.  Louis IX King of France was one of the promoters of the Crusades in the Holy Land in the 13th century and to give the crusaders a convenient departure point when sailing to the Middle East he ordered the construction of the fortified city of Aigues-Mortes, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea

Funerary sculpture

Works in the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay
This work is also known under title "Un fils de Niobé". The Louvre hold a marble version of a plaster composition which Pradier carried out whilst in Rome in December 1817 and subsequently sent to the École des Beaux-arts in Paris. Pradier takes his subject from verses 146 to 312 of book 6 of Ovid's "Metamorphosis". The work was submitted to the Paris Salon of 1822 from where it was purchased by the French State. In the sculpture one of the Niobids has received an arrow in his back, this fired by Artemis.[55]

Shown at the Paris Salon in 1824, this work was executed during Pradier's time in Rome.[56]

The Musée d'Orsay hold the marble version of "Sapho" which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1852. The Musée des Beaux-arts of Angers have a bronze reduction of the composition. The original model in plaster and wax and called  "Penserosa" -(the thoughtful one) is held by the Paris Musée des Arts décoratifs. "Sapho" was on display at the Salon in 1852 when the sculptor died suddenly; the work was then covered with a black veil and the artist posthumously awarded the medal of honour. The sculptor Pierre-Charles Simart executed a relief of this work in marble for Pradier's tomb. Pradier also executed a statuette of Sapho standing ("Sapho debout") and this is a much reproduced piece in various mediums. The poet stands with one hand placed on an ornate Ionic column and in the other hand she holds a lyre. This was shown at the 1848 Paris Salon and a bronze version of the work is held in Osborne House having been acquired by Queen Victoria in 1853.

In the time of the Ottoman Empire an "odalik" was a woman who lived in the sultan's harem. The version in the Lyon museum is in marble but the piece was subsequently cast in bronze in two sizes. A statuette of the same subject was executed by Pradier and was shown at the Paris Salon in 1841.

Works located in Geneva
After he finished his studies at the École de Dessin in Geneva and went up to Paris, the authorities in Geneva, aware of his talent, organised bursaries for him in 1809 and 1812 to help defray his expenses at the École des Beaux-Arts and to perhaps help cement this relationship he sent his Prix de Rome winning entry of 1813 to the city.  However, when in 1815 he tried to get the Geneva authorities to help finance the execution of a marble version of the composition "Orphée pleurant Eurydice" which they turned down, he perhaps realised that assistance from Geneva would be of a limited nature. He did however keep contact with friends and associates there and in 1819 the "Sociéte des Arts" in Geneva made him a "associé honoraire" and in that year they gave Pradier an order for two of the busts being commissioned to decorate the front of the "Orangerie du Jardin botanique" just created by A.P.de Candolle for the "Promenade des Bastions". Pradier was asked to execute the bust of Jean Jacques Rousseau in 1821 and Charles Bonnet in 1822. In 1825 he was asked to execute two further busts to decorate the Musée des Beaux-Arts just being built thanks to the generosity of the Rath family.  1830 saw the project to establish a monument honouring Rousseau come to fruition, Pradier's bronze being one of his best known works. In 1843 Pradier received private commissions to execute busts of the economist Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi and Abraham Auguste Saladin de Budé. A commission for the bust of Augustin-Pyramus de Candolle followed in 1845 and Pradier captured interest by producing a cylindrical pedestal for this with remarkable reliefs. This was also intended for the "Jardin botanique des Bastions". Pradier's final sculpture executed for Geneva was the bust of Guillaume-Henri Dufour.

After Pradier's death the Musée de Geneve acquired several original plaster models and a huge number of his design drawings. Slowly but surely the museum's collection grew and today a collection of more than 120 reliefs, statues and statuettes as well as design drawings are a fitting tribute to one of Geneva's finest sons.

Other works by Pradier are to be seen in Switzerland and details are given below. Pradier also sent to Geneva four medallions to be added to the Frédéric-César de La Harpe monument at Rolle on the Ile de la Harpe.[130]

"Émile si la vie et la mort de Socrate sont d'un sage, la vie et la mort de Jesus sont d'un Dieu." (If the life and death of Socrates are those of a wise man, the life and death of Jesus are those of a God), a quote from Rousseau's Émile ou De l'éducation of 1762. The statue's inauguration took place on 24 February 1835, although the inscription on the pedestal gives the year as 1838.
